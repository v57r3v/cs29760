EECS 281: Data Structures and Algorithms 
Course Overview
EECS 281   is an   introductory course   in data structures and   algorithms   at the undergraduate   level.    The objective of the course is to   present   a   number of fundamental   techniques to solve common programming problems.      For each   of these   problems, we will determine an abstract specification for a solution   and   examine one   or   more   potential   representations to implement the abstract specification, focusing on those with significant advantages   in time/space   required to solve large problem   instances.      When   appropriate, we will consider special cases of a general problem   that   admit   particularly   elegant solutions. 
After taking this course, students should   be able   to:
1.    Analyze the   behavior. of a code fragment,   predict   its   output,   and   repair any   errors   in   it.
2.      Read a specification of input data and   develop   a   program than   can   acquire,   store,   manipulate, and   produce required output.
3.      Study an algorithm, analyze   its time and space   complexity, and   determine   how effective   it will   be for different sized data   processing tasks.
4.      Study a complex   problem,   be able to   identify ways of decomposing   it   into simpler subproblems.    combine those subproblem solutions to yield solutions   to overall   problems, and to   be able to realize these   techniques   in   operational   code. 
5.    Analyze a problem and   identify   and   define   the   computing   requirements   appropriate to its   solution.
6.    Apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic   principles,   and   computer science   theory   in the   modeling and design of computer-based systems in   a way   that demonstrates comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design   choices.
7.      Optimize the algorithms and data structures used   to   solve   a   problem   to   reduce   both time and space complexity.
Lectures 
Each faculty   member will   have one lecture   recorded online,   live, at the scheduled   class   time.    Please   refer to the "Lecture   Recordings" at the   left for   a   link   to   each   video.      The videos will   be automatically   uploaded and   made available,   but   it usually   takes about   30   minutes from the end of lecture until   it appears.      Each   lecture   section   scheduled   in   a room will also   be streamed   live via Zoom; the links for those   appear   in the   "Calendar"   at   the   left.    Most   lectures also   have   playlists of the videos, that were   recorded   previously, using the same slides   but   instead of one   long   lecture video,   it   has   been   broken down into   multiple videos with a specific topic for each video.
Prerequisites 
Students   must   have obtained a grade of C or   better   in each   of   EECS   203   and   EECS         280, or have equivalent   knowledge of discrete   mathematics and C++   programming.            MATH 465 or MATH 565 are accepted   in   lieu   of   EECS   203.      Due   to   the   overwhelming   number of students   interested   in this course, we will strictly enforce the prerequisites.    If you failed to complete, or   if you   received a   grade   of C-   or   below   in any of the   prerequisites, then you   must drop   EECS 281 this term, and   re-enroll   at   a      later term, after you   have completed all prerequisites with a grade of   C   or   better. 
Students will   be expected to use the "make"   utility to   automate   C++   compilation.    Also,   students should   be able to generate   plots using   MS-Excel, OpenOffice,   Gnuplot,   or similar tools.    Students with questions about whether they have sufficient   preparation   for   this course should speak with the   instructor(s) as soon   as   possible. 
Two-Attempt Rule 
Per departmental   policy, each student   may attempt   EECS 281 twice at   most.      One attempt   in   EECS 281   is defined as one   instance where   EECS 281 appears   on   your   UM   transcript. -   including   but   not   limited to a letter grade (A-E),   withdrawal   (W),   pass/fail (P/F),   incomplete (I).    At   most one attempt from Summer 2014   or earlier will   count towards this   limit.    If you drop   EECS 281   prior to the date   which   a   W   would   appear   on   your transcript, then that would   not count as an attempt for the   purposes   of this   policy.   Exceptions to this   policy can be granted by   the   appropriate   Chief   Program Advisor under extraordinary circumstances only.
Grading Policy 
Your work   in this course   is composed of: attending   lecture and   lab sections,   reading assigned   material, completing   lab assignments, completing   projects, taking a midterm exam, and taking a final exam.    Final   grades will   be   based   on   the   total   points   earned   on   the   labs,   projects, and exams.    Factors such as   improvement   and   course   participation may   be   used to adjust your final grade, especially   if it falls on   a   borderline.      The weight   assigned to each category   is as   follows:
Lab Assignments 20% (each lab assignment weighted   equally)
Projects 40% (each project weighted   equally)
Midterm   Exam 20%
Final   Exam 20%
Grading Errors 
We   make every effort to grade correctly,   however we do sometimes   make   mistakes.
Arithmetic errors can   be corrected   in   person   by your   IA or GSI.      If you   believe something was graded   incorrectly, you   may submit   it for a regrade. 代 写EECS 281: Data Structures and AlgorithmsC/C++
代做程序编程语言   All exam   regrade requests   must   be   made on Gradescope.    Regrade   requests for other assignments   must   be   made via email explaining the technical   reason(s) that would   make a   regrade necessary.    The email   must   be sent to [email   protected] with “EECS 281 Regrade   Request” in the subject   line.    All   regrade   requests   must   be submitted   no   later      than five working days after the graded work is   returned to the   student   -   after   that,   your   score on the assignment   in question stands.    This   includes   requesting that   errors   in recording a score   in Canvas   be fixed. Regrade requests must be an objective argument about which specific rubric items were inconsistently or improperly applied, not a subjective argument about what things should be worth.    The work in question will   be   regraded carefully from scratch   in   its entirety, with consideration   given   to the written   request.    As a   result, your grade   might go up,   stay the   same, or go down. 
Be careful with Canvas' "TOTAL"   points --   it counts   anything which   has   no   recorded score as   not existing (rather than 0).    This works   great when we're   partway   through   the   semester:   if you've gotten a 98 on   Projects   1 and 2, your   projects   total would   be   98.
When we get to the end of the semester, something you   didn't   turn   in   should   count   as   a   0,   but   it counts as   not existing.    So   before you complain   that   your total   says   83.01   but you're getting a   B-,   make sure you don't   have any   missed assignments   --   one   missed lab could   put your actual total   below   83.
For the exams, we will begin accepting regrade   requests two   calendar   days   after   your   exam   is   released to you on Gradescope.    This   is to force you to wait   until   you   have carefully   reviewed your exam   responses and the   rubric before submitting a   regrade request.    Regrade requests for the exams will   close about   one   week   after   the   scores   are   released.    When exam scores are released on   Gradescope,   everyone will   receive   an email stating the exact start and end   dates for   regrade   requests.For lab handwritten parts, you have until the day before the corresponding exam the lab in question to dispute your score (the day before the midterm for labs 1-5, final for labs 6-10). 
Incompletes 
Incompletes will generally not be given except   in extreme circumstances.   In accordance   with   university   policy, doing   poorly   in a course   is   not a valid   reason for an   incomplete.   If you are   having   problems   in the course,   please talk to the   instructor(s) as soon   as   you are   able.
Minimum Competency 
IF you achieve at   least a 55% average   on the   Programming   Projects AND a   50% average (curved scores) on the exams AND a   75%   average   on   lab   assignments, you      will   pass this course. You must achieve ALL of these thresholds separately -   very   high exam scores will   not compensate for very low   project scores,   and vice   versa.      If you   receive at   least 220   project   points AND at   least   100 exam   points total for the term AND at   least   150   lab   points, you are guaranteed at   least a   grade   of C   in   the   course. 
Rounding   is   not guaranteed, so 219.999999   project   points OR 99.999999 exam   points OR 149.999999   lab   points does not guarantee passing.    If you do   not   meet these minimums you   might still   pass,   but we consider each such case   individually.    The   closer   you are, the   more   improvement you show, and the fewer portions   that   you   are   not passing all improve your   chances.
Curving 
The Midterm and Final Exams will be curved if needed, and any curve applied can only be in your favor.    For example, if the Midterm Exam turns out with a lower average than we would like, we might set a bar of say 46 points for passing the Midterm, rather than 50. 
The table below gives you a lower bound as to what your grade would be. That is, we may perform. a final curving, which again may improve someone’s grade, but never reduce it.    Rounding is not guaranteed, thus 90% overall guarantees at least a grade of A-, 89.999999% does not - the cutoff must go somewhere and no matter where it goes, there will always be somebody barely on either side of it. 
Grades shown here are superseded by the “ Minimum Competency” rules shown above. If you achieve ALL thresholds, then the guarantee that you will receive at least a C in the course overrules the scale shown in the table below.    However, if you fail to meet at least one of the thresholds, then you may still receive a C- or below even if the scale shown in the table below says that you should be getting a higher grade. For example, if you have 60% overall, and achieve at least the minimum 55% on projects and 50% on exams, you will receive a C, even though the table below says that you should receive a D. On the other hand, if you only achieve 50% on projects, but 100% on everything else, then despite that being 80% overall, your grade will be a C-, even though the table below says that you should receive a B-.
